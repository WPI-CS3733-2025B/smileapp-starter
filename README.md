------------------------
## Running the application
-----------------------

### To run this example:
- Start the application with the following command:
    ```
    python smile.py
    ```

### To run the tests:
- run the tests for Model (unittest)
    ``` 
    python -m unittest -v tests/test_models.py 
    ```
- run the tests for routes (pytest)
    ```
    python -m pytest -v tests/test_routes.py
    ```
- run the selenium tests
    * Download the Chrome webdriver for your Chrome browser version (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads); extract and copy it under `C:\Webdriver` folder.
    * Run the SmileApp in a terminal window: 
        ```
        python smile.py
        ```
    * Run the selenium tests
    ```
        python tests/test_selenium.py
    ```

### To run the tests with "coverage" analysis

   ```
   coverage run -m pytest -v tests/test_models.py
   coverage run -m pytest -v tests/test_routes.py
   ```

* Use coverage report to report on the results:
    ```
    coverage report -m
    ```
    
* For a nicer presentation, use coverage html to get annotated HTML listings detailing missed lines:
    ```
    coverage html
    coverage xml
    ```
